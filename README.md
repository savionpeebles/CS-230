Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

A social media company by the name of Chat Away needed to create a mobile application for their website that had been doing very well, it was imperative that we stay within their budget, design the app the same way their website is designed and remain on their set project timeline.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

When developing this document I thought I did a very good job of making sure that the clients were getting the best possible results while still adhering to their requirements that they had given us at the start of the project. It was very vital that we gave the client good insight on the postives and negatives that any potential solution or feature could bring.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Using a design document was a great way to track my progress and update the client on the devleopment of their software. It is a very helpful thing because it breaks down the ideas that not everyone who has a tech background will understand so it makes it easier for common people to understand and help with these specifications. It is just a great way to measure your progress and how effeciently the project is going.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would probably improve the recommendations at the end and just expand on them slightly more so that the client has a real strong pull in the direction of the software or operating system that I recommended. This is a big portion of the project because it reinforces all the work we did up to that point before.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Addressing the user's needs is the whole reason that the client came to us in the first place. If we don't properly assess and then focus on the needs at hand, a client will begin to look elsewhere for the things they actually need and desire. It is impertative for any project that we focus on the client and user's needs because it reflects on us as a company if a user and client isn't happy with the product we have given them, this can lead to loss of customer retention and future dissatifaction with other clients.
